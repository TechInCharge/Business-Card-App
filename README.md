## Business Card App  / AppBrewery Course app ðŸ“‡


This is a sample app, learned as an exmaple from appbrewery.co course.
Even though it is from the course, but the code has been completly written from scratch.


## What did we create

The App is design to act like a business card for you, where it will display an Avatar (image extracted from a network location) , and some styled texed and some cards containing your information.

Below is the finished APP from my emulator.
